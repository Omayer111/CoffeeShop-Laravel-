# CoffeeShop-Laravel-


fullstack website developed for my web development lab with Laravel

this website has frontend to show what the store offers and backend for the admin to select what to show on the website and get the reservation and user data and if wanted then also can edit the information shown on the website with the help of database. The whole information is stored in the database and also shown from the database.
